# Weather API 

## How's The Weather Today?

This weather API is an easy to use, simple application that allows you to find the current temperature of any city in the world. 
Whether you're on your couch curious, on a trip, or trying to book one, this app is for you. Each city is saved just in case you want to keep it on hand for a quick reminder.
Once the user inputs a city, it will show the current weather as well as the 5 day forecast!
