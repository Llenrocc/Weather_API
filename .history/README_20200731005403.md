## How's The Weather Today?

This is an easy to use, simple application that allows you to find the current temperature of any city in the world. 
Whether you're on your couch, on a trip, or trying to book one, this app is for you. Each city is saved just in case you want to keep it on hand for a quick reminder.
Once the user inputs a city, it will show the current weather as well as the 5 day forecast!

## Motivation for Development

We all use our weather apps more often than we think. Whether we're wondering if we need a jacket outside or planning a trip ahead of time. the focus was creating 
a convenient tool that you can use whenever you want, where ever you want.

### User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to type in any city and click search.

* When the user clicks search, the current weather is to appear.

* When current weather appears, the 5 day forecast is to show

* Once user clicks search, the city is to be saved in a list for future reference.

## Breakdown

This project was created using Javascript, HTML, css, OpenWeatherMap API, and Google Fonts. 

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was properly using the different OpenWeatherMap API calls. There is a lot of useful information on the site, but actually writing it 
out and utilizing it, is really difficult. A lot of things I don't think I did correctly. I would not have been able to get this far without help from Google.
I finished our group project first, and it did help with many aspects of this project, however, I still struggle with writing out the necessary syntax correctly.
Thankfully OpenWeatherMap had some instructions on how to properly traverse this many API calls. I was hoping to get everything working after the project, but I 
am not sure what to do right now. Initially, I would have the city appear, but not save. And then the city would save, but it wouldn't show the current temperature.
As of submission, I can't get my 5 day forecast to appear. I have spent enough time for now, and I want to go back and fix it.
